current months', planned meetings, in the form of a calendar. Current
day-cell should be selected by default.

able to make any changes

prev/next button), each month should show all the dates in tabular
format, like in actual calendar.
iii) Day Cells should be filled, if any meeting is kept, with a some
design. There should also be a design for overlapping meetings.
iv) Upon click the day's cell, a view should pop, showing all meetings,
along a 24 hr timeline, with the slots covering the exact duration of
each meeting.
v) Upon clicking on a meeting, its details should pop up in another
view
c) Admin Flow:
i) For admin, a create button should be there in calendar view, to
create a meeting.
ii) Upon clicking on create button, details view should open.
iii) Once created, it should appear on the calendar view.
iv) Upon clicking on an already created meeting, same details view
should open.
v) Details view should be a form
vi) Admin should be able to make changes in meeting details form,
and submit.
vii) Admin should be able to delete a meeting as well, with another
button
viii) Meeting details, should cover when, where and purpose. Also, by
default username of the admin, who kept the meeting, should also
show in non-editable format.

7) Error Views and messages- 
You have to handle each major error response
(like 404 or 500) with a different page. Also, all kind of errors, exceptions and
messages should be handled properly on frontend. The user should be aware all
the time on frontend about what is happening in the system.
